0.1.0 (Aug 9 2014)
===================
[Based on autocomplete-plus 0.21.0.]

* Forked from [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/saschagehlich/autocomplete-plus).
* Per-provider file blacklisting.
* Removed autoloading of FuzzyProvider.

This fork functions as a library for Atom packages, not a useful package in its
own right.
